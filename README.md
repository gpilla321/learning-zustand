Small app to use zustand for the first time! 

This is how the the application looks like. I used zustand to state managament of the items list and search.

The UI is very simple, and there are three main states. 
- First render: display all items
- Selected item: once the user selected an item it is stored in the zustand store.
- Filtering: once the user fills the input, hitting enter or pressing the search button, updates the store triggerining a list update based on the findings
